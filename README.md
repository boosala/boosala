# Boosala

#### Run Boosala locally
* Be sure to install or update your version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).
* Open `boosala-react` and install dependencies using `yarn install`. All dependencies for the app should be uploaded at this stage.
* Execute `yarn start` and your browser should open the site at `http://localhost:3000/`. Leave the server running while acessing the site. You may need to change the port if you have other servers running on `port 3000`. If you have trouble accessing the site, check `yarn.log` in the directory for more details.
* `yarn start` should only need to be executed once since it will rebuild the project after every save. If it is not refreshing properly, execute `yarn start` again.
